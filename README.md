# Natural-Earth-Shapefile-World-Map-with-Kashmir-as-Integral-part-of-India
The shapefile uploaded here provides a World Map where Indian boundaries comply with the survey of India records. It therefore shows a world map with Kashmir as an integral part of India.

This project is built on the work of Anuj Tiwari (Email: anujtiwari.iitr@gmail.com) who has made the most updated version of the India Boundary Shape File that represents the boundary of the Republic of India as per survey of India records. 

The world map shapefile provided by Natural Earth admin-0 features follows the "Disputed boundaries policy" - https://www.naturalearthdata.com/about/disputed-boundaries-policy/. I have updated this admin-0 layer using Indian boundaries shapefile from Anuj Tiwari.
